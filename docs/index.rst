   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to conda's documentation!
=================================

The documentation here, within the main conda repository, is work-in-progress.  Our goal is
to split off the pieces of the conda/conda-docs repository that are conda-specific and
conda-build-specific, bringing those project-specific docs into their respective repos.
The benefit will be that associated documentation can then be versioned along with the project.
